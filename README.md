# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition using Classification Algorithms and Neural Networks

Tasks performed:
1. Implement Logistic Regression, train it on the MNIST digit images and tune hyper parameters.
2. Implement single hidden layer Neural Network, train it on the MNIST digit images and tune hyper parameters such as the number of units in the hidden layer.
3. Use a publicly available convolutional neural network package, train it on the MNIST digit images and tune hyper parameters.
